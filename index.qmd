## About

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
I am Dr. Dattatray Mongad, currently serving as the "Lead Domain Engineer" at Persistent Systems Limited in Pune, specializing in Bioinformatics. My Ph.D. in Biotechnology was completed at the National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, where I concentrated on microbiome research. A significant achievement during my doctoral research was the development of [MicFunPred](https://github.com/microDM/MicFunPred "MicFunPred: A conserved approach to predict functional profiles from 16S rRNA gene sequence data"), a tool for conservative functional prediction based on amplicon data. Throughout my Ph.D. tenure, I actively participated in diverse microbiome projects, spanning topics such as infant microbiome, mental health and digital therapeutics, and type 2 diabetes (T2D). My expertise lies in Next-Generation Sequence data analysis, multi-omics, Machine Learning (ML), and the development of workflows using Snakemake.
